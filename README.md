# Object Detection with YOLO
I use experiencor's keras-yolo3 project as a pre-trained model to perform object detection on an unseen photograph.  
All functions and classes are in yolo3_one_file_to_detect_them_all.py file.  

The pre-trained weights need to be downloaded from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights.
