# Object Detection with YOLOv3
I use experiencor's keras-yolo3 project as a pre-trained model to perform object detection on an unseen photograph.  
All functions and classes are in yolo3_one_file_to_detect_them_all.py file.  

The pre-trained weights is downloaded from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights.  

**How to**  
1. clone my project and cd to the project
2. create virtual environment 
3. activate your virtual environment
4. install packages in requirements.txt
5. run object detection in notebook or python file as you want
